mcmc
=====

A package for Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

mcmc provides simple classes for stochastic processes and markov chains
(similar to 'stochastic' package) and Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
The main focus is to quickly generate markov chains on different objects with
defined probability distributions to find minima/maxima of cost functions.
