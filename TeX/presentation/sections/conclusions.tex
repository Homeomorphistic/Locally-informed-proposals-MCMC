	\frametitle{Conclusions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item LIP algorithm is decreasing the distance quicker than RN,
		\item LIP converges to some value, which is always smaller than the RN,
		\item LIP reaches better results in feasible time,
		\item Only first hundreds iterations matter,
		\item LIP algorithm is considerably slower for a longer run.
	\end{itemize}
