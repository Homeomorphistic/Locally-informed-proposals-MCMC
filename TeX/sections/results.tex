In this section we will present the results of simulations and compare them with previous methods and true optima.

\subsection{Initial condition}
	First we have to check if changing the initial state makes any difference to the output of an algorithm. This is achieved via setting a different seed and repeating algorithms for the same number of iterations. Seeds guarantee us the different ``randomness'' with each seed. It is because the generators are only generating \textit{pseudo-random numbers} which we can control. Both algorithms will have the same seeds and in our case these are $1,2,3,4$.
