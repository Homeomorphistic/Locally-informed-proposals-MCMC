#  **Locally-informed proposals in Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with applications**

"Locally-informed proposals in Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with applications" is an initial title of my master thesis. I'm planning to finish it together with my supervisor Paweł Lorek in summer term of 2022.

The idea of locally-informed proposals is introduced in "Oops I took a gradient: scalable sampling for discrete distributions" by W. Grathwohl and others. We want to mix it with the usage of Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in _travelling salesmen_ and _decryption_ problems, that were used in [C. Karpiński's](https://github.com/cyrylk) master thesis called ["On use of Monte Carlo Markov Chains to decode encrypted text and to solve travelling salesman problem"](https://github.com/cyrylk/MCMC).

The hypothesis is, that this addition will improve models and some cost of computational complexity.
